# 0x11 - printf
For this project, we built a printf function as is in C.
The printf function sends in a formated string to the standard output. After this formatting, the string can output formatted variables and special characters for example new lines, backslashes and tabspaces.

The parameters passed into printf() are arguments. These arguments are seperated by a comma.
